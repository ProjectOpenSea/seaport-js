/**
 * When fulfilling a basic order, the following requirements need to be checked to ensure that the order will be fulfillable:
 * 1. Offer checks need to be performed to ensure that the offerer still has sufficient balance and approvals
 * 2. The fulfiller should have sufficient balance of all consideration items except for those with an
 *    item type that matches the order's offered item type â€” by way of example, if the fulfilled order offers
 *    an ERC20 item and requires an ERC721 item to the offerer and the same ERC20 item to another recipient,
 *    the fulfiller needs to own the ERC721 item but does not need to own the ERC20 item as it will be sourced from the offerer.
 * 3. If the fulfiller does not elect to utilize a proxy, they need to have sufficient approvals set for the
 *    Consideration contract for all ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 consideration items on the fulfilled order except
 *    for ERC20 items with an item type that matches the order's offered item type.
 * 4. If the fulfiller does elect to utilize a proxy, they need to have sufficient approvals set for their
 *    respective proxy contract for all ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 consideration items on the fulfilled order
 *    except for ERC20 items with an item type that matches the order's offered item type.
 * 5. If the fulfilled order specifies Ether (or other native tokens) as consideration items, the fulfiller must
 *    be able to supply the sum total of those items as msg.value.
 *
 * @returns the list of insufficient owner and proxy approvals
