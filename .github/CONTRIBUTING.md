## Installation

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions. Execute `nvm use`, if you have `nvm` installed.

Then, run `npm`

## Running tests

To run the tests:

```
npm run test
```

The first run might fail due to typechain needing to compile. If so, just run the command again.
